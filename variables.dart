//Variable Definition:
// Variables are containers used to store value in the program.
//There are different types of variables where you can keep different kinds of values.
//Here is an example of creating a variable and initializing it.

// Variable Types:
// They are called data types. We will learn more about data types later in this dart tutorial.

// String: For storing text value. E.g. “John” [Must be in quotes]
// int: For storing integer value. E.g. 10, -10, 8555 [Decimal is not included]
// double: For storing floating point values. E.g. 10.0, -10.2, 85.698 [Decimal is included]
// num: For storing any type of number. E.g. 10, 20.2, -20 [both int and double]
// bool: For storing true or false. E.g. true, false [Only stores true or false values]
// var: For storing any value. E.g. ‘Bimal’, 12, ‘z’, true
